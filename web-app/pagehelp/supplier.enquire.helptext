== Supplier Account Enquiry
=== Overview
* Display transactions on a period by period basis or all open transactions
* Display values in any defined currency
* Link to source documents
* Link to remittance advice history for auto-paid suppliers
=== Description
This enquiry facility allows you to display the transactions either on a period by period basis (whether fully allocated
or not) or all open transactions (i.e. where there is an unallocated amount). You may link from this enquiry to the
underlying source documents, if you have the appropriate permission, by clicking on the relevant document code in the
list of transactions.

To see how a line on the account was allocated against other lines on the account, click the righthand side of the
Unallocated column for the line you are interested in - even when there is no value in the Unallocated column.

For suppliers paid by the auto-payments system, remittance advices are created each time they are paid. To display a
history of the remittance advices sent to the supplier, click on the current balance amount. If there is no link
from the current balance amount to the remittance advice enquiry screen this will be because there are no remittance
advices to display for this supplier.

To display all open transactions, set the Period to 'none'. Choosing any other period setting will display all the
transactions for that period whether fully allocated or not.
[[
{{info}} Note that in the list of period purchases values, the figures include any taxes and are also subject to correct
use of the 'affects turnover' facility of journals etc.

You may display the values in any of the currencies defined in your company. Choosing a display currency of 'none' is
the same as choosing the currency the account is held in (e.g. EU Euros for a French supplier) except that when you
navigate to the next enquiry screen with 'none' as the display currency, the new screen will also display its values in
its 'normal' currency. If you had chosen EU Euros as the display currency, by contrast, then navigated to another
enquiry screen the new screen would display its values in EU Euros whatever its 'normal' currency might be.

The system cannot possibly hold all values for a transaction in all defined currencies at the date a transaction is
posted. Consequently, choosing to display an enquiry screen in some currencies will cause an 'on the fly' conversion as
at today's exchange rate. This can lead to minor rounding differences between, say, the addition of the individual
transactions on an account that have not been fully allocated and the current balance displayed for the account. It can
also lead to a difference between the perceived value of a line posted to the account (which might be shown via an 'on
the fly' conversion and therefore at today's exchange rate) and the displayed value of the line on the source document
itself (which might be shown using its 'normal' values as at the date of posting). To warn you when values are being
shown using an 'on the fly' conversion, the background colour of the Display Currency dropdown list will be highlighted.
[[
{{info}} When viewing a foreign currency account in other than its own currency, you may see foreign exchange difference
documents that were not visible when displaying it in its own currency. This is the result of the system dynamically
keeping track of profits and losses on exchange which have no effect on the foreign currency values themselves.
