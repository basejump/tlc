== Customer Contact
=== Overview
* Contacts belong to an address
* Identifier allows distinguishing between two contacts with the same name
* Specify special usages for a contact
=== Description
You may define any number of contacts per address. A contact could be a department or a person. For
individuals, you should enter their full name as they would wish to see it on a letter addressed to them.
The system does not attempt to distinguish between given names, middle names or family names since such
concepts do not hold in all countries and, even when they do, confusion arises with countries where the
middle name is the one used by default. Also, there are some countries where people only have a single name
which makes splitting it into multiple fields impossible.

An identifier field is available and can be used for individuals to hold things such as job title (e.g.
Chief Accountant), the department they belong to (e.g. Accounts Department) or even a unique reference
number assigned to them by their company (similar to an internal mail box address in the U.S.) as is
quite common in Australia. The main purpose of the identifier field is to uniquely identify the intended
recipient within the company.

Usages are system defined codes that can belong to one, and only one, contact within an address (although
within another address a contact may have the same usage). Usages are used by certain programs to automatically
include the contact in the address of a particular piece of correspondence. For example, in printing a
debtors statement the system will first of all find the address with the Statement usage. It will then look
at the contacts within that address to see if one of them has the Statement usage and, if so, that contact
will be included in the address printed on the debtors statement. If not, the address will be printed without
any specific contact information.

{{info}} Note that if you mark a contact as a debtors statement contact, this will have no effect unless
the address to which the contact belongs is also marked as the debtors statement address since the system
//first of all// finds the appropriate address to use //and only then// looks for a specific contact within
that address.
