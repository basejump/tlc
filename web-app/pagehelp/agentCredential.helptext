== Agent Credentials
=== Overview
* Add new RESTful agent credentials to a Company User
* Each Company User can have any number of credentials
* Switch a set of credentials between active and inactive as required
=== Description
TLC has what is called a RESTful interface that allows other programs on your intranet, or even on the
Internet, to access the system and to perform various tasks, including such as posting sales invoices
etc in to the books of account.

To do this, these 'client' programs must assume the identity of an existing user within the company and,
in doing so, they gain the access rights of that user and can do whatever that user can do - within the
limits of the facilties provided by the RESTful interface.

To assume the identity of an existing user the program needs to know two things: 1) an agent code and 2) a
shared secret. The agent code is a 20 character identifier for this set of credentials and can be regarded
as public knowledge. The shared secret is a 40 character string of characters that only the company
administrator and the client program should know. The shared secret should definitely //not// be regarded
as public knowledge. Although it isn't exactly true, it is reasonable to think of the agent code and the
shared secret as being like a login id and password, respectively.

When you add agent credentials to a Company User, the system automatically creates the agent code and
shared secret values for you. All you have to do is to decide whether to make these credentials active or not
and, if you do make them active, to advise the person/people responsible for maintaining the client program(s) of
the new values for the code and secret. Similarly, if you deactivate or delete an existing set of credentials,
the client program(s) will need to be modified accordingly.
