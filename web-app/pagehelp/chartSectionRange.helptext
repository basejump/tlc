== Chart Section Range
=== Overview
* You must define a single 'include' range
* The 'include' range specifies the overall minimum and maximum values allowed for each code segment
* You may then define any number of 'exclude' ranges
* The 'exclude' ranges cut out various sub-ranges from the overall 'include' range
* You may define any number of 'disallow' ranges
* The 'disallow' ranges specify invalid //combinations// of segment values
=== Description
A range is entered as if you were entering an account code during data entry with the following exceptions:
# You must enter //all// code segments, even those with defaults
# You cannot use mnemonics
# Using an asterisk (*) for any segment value has special meaning as described in the main text
[[
{{info}} The logic of ranges is that an account code must pass the 'include' range test and fail none of the 'exclude'
or 'disallow' range tests to be accepted in to the section.
]]
As mentioned in the list above, an asterisk used as a segment value has special meaning. In the case of an 'include' range,
using an asterisk for both the From and To segment values means all possible values for that segment are acceptable. For
'exclude' and 'disallow' ranges, using an asterisk for both the From and To segment values means that no test is to be
performed. In //all// cases ('include', 'exclude' and 'disallow' ranges) an asterisk in, say, the From value and an actual
value for the To value of a segment will be taken to mean 'From the lowest possible value up to and including the given value'.
Conversely, an actual value for the From value and an asterisk for the To value of a segment will be taken to mean 'From the
specified value to up the highest possible value'. Fortunately, this feels more intuitive to use that it does to explain!

In general, it is better to create more simple ranges than fewer complex ones and, since it is mandatory that the ranges
define the range of 'account numbers' permitted in the chart section, this is a good place to start...

Assuming that your chart section uses three segments representing account number, department and project of six digits,
two letters and three digits respectively and that this chart section could hold account numbers 300000 through 349999 and
360000 through 399999 then you could define ranges such as:
|**__Type__**|**__From__**|**__To__**|
|**Include**|**300000-*-\***|**399999-*-\***|
|**Exclude**|**350000-*-\***|**359999-*-\***|
In the above example, we have said that the overall range of account numbers that this section can hold is from 300000 to
399999 inclusive, and that all department codes and project codes are acceptable. We have then excluded the account number
range from 350000 to 359999. Note how the asterisks in the 'exclude' range are taken to mean 'no test' rather than 'exclude
everything. See, we said it was intuitive! The result of these ranges is that this section can include account numbers from
300000 to 349999 and from 360000 to 399999 inclusive.

Note that the above ranges do not imply that, for example, an account number of 399999 is //actually// a valid account number,
it is simply the upper value of //possible// account numbers that this section may hold. What account numbers //actually//
exist is determined by the Code Element Values where they are listed specifically. Additionally, it is important to note that account
number ranges may not overlap between chart sections, otherwise the system would not know in which chart section to create any
given account number. However, it would be acceptable to have another section use all or part of the 350000 through 359999 range,
in our example, since it is excluded from this section.

So far our example specifies that account number ranges 300000 through 349999 and 360000 and 399999 are allowed in this
section, and that all department codes and project codes are acceptable (because we used an asterisk, *, for those segments).
Suppose, however, that account numbers 300000 through 349999 could use only departments codes HO and EX, then we would extend our
ranges as follows:
|**__Type__**|**__From__**|**__To__**|
|Include|300000-*-*|399999-*-*|
|Exclude|350000-*-*|359999-*-*|
|**Disallow**|**300000-AA-\***|**349999-EW-\***|
|**Disallow**|**300000-EY-\***|**349999-HN-\***|
|**Disallow**|**300000-HP-\***|**349999-ZZ-\***|
As you can see, it's a tough job to pick out specific codes and requires a bit of 'lateral thinking!' What we did for
the 300000 through 349999 range was to disallow all departments //except// EX and HO. In general, numeric codes are a little
easier to work with, but even then we would have had to use the same basic logic - it might just have been a little easier
to visualize.
[[
{{info} Numeric code elements use the digits 0 through 9 and alphabetic codes, by default, use the letters A through Z
as shown in our examples. However it is possible, when installing your system, to specify that alphabetic code elements
should be lower case (i.e. a through z). The system will automatically convert the codes you enter to the correct case
for your system.
]]
Now suppose that accounts 360000 through 399999 could use //any// department codes //except// HO and EX and, additionally,
that accounts 385000 through 385999 could not use departments FA through FZ either, then we would add to our ranges as follows:
|**__Type__**|**__From__**|**__To__**|
|Include|300000-*-*|399999-*-*|
|Exclude|350000-*-*|359999-*-*|
|Disallow|300000-AA-*|349999-EW-*|
|Disallow|300000-EY-*|349999-HN-*|
|Disallow|300000-HP-*|349999-ZZ-*|
|**Disallow**|**360000-HO-\***|**399999-HO-\***|
|**Disallow**|**360000-EX-\***|**399999-EX-\***|
|**Disallow**|**385000-FA-\***|**385999-FZ-\***|
Here it has taken us two additional 'disallow' ranges to prohibit the use of EX and HO departments from the 360000 through
399999 account number range plus an additional 'disallow' to also prohibit departments FA through FZ from the 385000 through
385999 account number range.

Now, let's limit the EX, HO and FA through FZ departments from using project codes. If this is our goal then it would be helpful to the
end user if we defined a default 'No Project' value such as 000 for the section since then they wouldn't even have to enter a project
code segment at all. Our new set of ranges would be as follows:
|**__Type__**|**__From__**|**__To__**|
|Include|300000-*-*|399999-*-*|
|Exclude|350000-*-*|359999-*-*|
|Disallow|300000-AA-*|349999-EW-*|
|Disallow|300000-EY-*|349999-HN-*|
|Disallow|300000-HP-*|349999-ZZ-*|
|Disallow|360000-HO-*|399999-HO-*|
|Disallow|360000-EX-*|399999-EX-*|
|Disallow|385000-FA-*|385999-FZ-*|
|**Disallow**|**\*-EX-001**|**\*-EX-999**|
|**Disallow**|**\*-HO-001**|**\*-HO-999**|
|**Disallow**|**\*-FA-001**|**\*-FZ-999**|
We hope by this time that you can follow what's going on; we've disallowed all project codes except 000 from the chosen
department ranges. Finally, just for the excitement of it, let's disallow any account from using project codes 777:
|**__Type__**|**__From__**|**__To__**|
|Include|300000-*-*|399999-*-*|
|Exclude|350000-*-*|359999-*-*|
|Disallow|300000-AA-*|349999-EW-*|
|Disallow|300000-EY-*|349999-HN-*|
|Disallow|300000-HP-*|349999-ZZ-*|
|Disallow|360000-HO-*|399999-HO-*|
|Disallow|360000-EX-*|399999-EX-*|
|Disallow|385000-FA-*|385999-FZ-*|
|Disallow|*-EX-001|*-EX-999|
|Disallow|*-HO-001|*-HO-999|
|Disallow|*-FA-001|*-FZ-999|
|**Disallow**|**\*-*-777**|**\*-*-777**|
If you're feeling shell-shocked at this point, we quite understand, however, a more typical range definition for a
section might be something like:
|**__Type__**|**__From__**|**__To__**|
|Include|500000-*-200|599999-*-299|
