== Accounts Receivable Journal Entry
=== Overview
* Post values between accounts within the Accounts Receivable Ledger
* Mark as affecting account turnover figures or not
* Set a due date for settlement purposes
* Automatic document number generation depending on configuration
=== Description
The Accounts Receivable journal entry system uses a programming technique called Ajax to modify data on the page without you
having to manually update the page by clicking a button. For example, as you enter an account code and then press Tab,
the system contacts the server to verify the account exists and to display the account name as confirmation. The system
is therefore sensitive to the performance of your server and the communications between your server and your browser. A
company's own server and intranet should provide high performance, the public Internet using a shared server much less so.

In the top portion of the page is an Affects Turnover check box. If you check this box the journal values will update the
turnover figures of the customer accounts involved. Leaving the box unchecked means that the turnover figures on the accounts
will not be affected.

A Due Date field is also included in the top portion of the screen. This allows you to control when the journal values
will be regarded as being due for settlement.

The line by line area contains a scrolling list of lines for you to enter data in to. There are a reasonable number of
lines to begin with, but should you require more lines, click the 'More Lines' button at the bottom of the page. You will
not lose any data you have already entered by doing this.
[[
{{info}} Any blank lines will be ignored for posting purposes as will any line without a customer account code -
even if there is other data on the line.

When you have finished entering your data, either click the Auto Allocation button or the No Allocation button. Clicking
the Auto Allocation button will post your journal and then set off open items within each sub-ledger account against one
another on a simple 'order of data entry' basis. Clicking the No Allocation button, by contrast, performs no such allocations
within sub-ledger accounts.
