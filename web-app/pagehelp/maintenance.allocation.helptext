== Manual Allocation
=== Overview
* Allocate a selected line on an account to another line on that account
* Record exchange differences between lines of different currencies
=== Description
Manual allocation allows you to specify how a line on an account is allocated to other lines on the account. For example,
specifying a particular invoice (or invoices) that a credit note clears.

ready for you enter the amount to be allocated to the chosen target line.

Allocation is always done in the currency of the account, even when a source document of a different currency has been
posted to the account. In such cases where one or both of the lines being allocated from/to was not entered in the account
currency, then depending upon the configuration of your system, you may be allowed to write off an allocation exchange
difference.

For example (and assuming your system was configured to allow this), consider a US Dollar account that had a Canadian
Dollar invoice for 100.00 CAD posted to it when the exchange rate was 0.92 thus showing an amount to be allocated for
the invoice of 92 USD. The settlement of the invoice is also done in Canadian Dollars by a bank transfer of 100.00 CAD
when the exchange rate was 0.91, thus showing an amount available for allocation of 91 USD. In fact, the 91 USD settlement
is intended to fully allocate the 92 USD invoice. In such cases, you may write off the 1 USD as an exchange difference
during the manual allocation process. Note, however, that your company administrator will have set a percentage limit
to the amount that can be written off in this way.

Once you have entered all the relevant information, click the Allocate button to perform the allocation. If the
allocated amount fully 'uses up' the unallocated amount of the source line you will be returned to the transaction list
screen for the relevant account, otherwise you will be returned to this manual allocation screen to continue allocating
to other lines on the account. If you do not wish to allocate any more amounts, use the 'drill up' button just after the
title of this page to return to the transaction list from whence you came.
