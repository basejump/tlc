== Customer Address
=== Overview
* Specify destination country
* Use country specific formatting where defined
* Specify special usages for an address
=== Description
Your system administrator can define address formats suitable for use in different countries. A few have been
predefined in the standard system. Each country is given a default format which your system administrator can
change. When you select the country for the address the default address format for that country is displayed.

Some countries can use more than one format. For example, a Chinese address written in Chinese script has a
completely different format from the same address when written in Latin script. Also, addresses in Hong Kong,
although part of China, have a different format altogether. Consequently, even after the default format for the
chosen country has been displayed, you may specify the exact format you wish to use from those available within
your system.
[[
{{exclaim}} If you change the format (or country) after data has been entered in to an address, you can possibly
lose data if the new format does not use the same fields as the existing format.

Your system supervisor will have marked certain fields of an address as being required fields, and you must enter
data for such fields. Similarly, the system administrator can specify that a field must contain a certain pattern
of characters that your data must comply with.

Addresses can be marked with special system defined usages. For example, when you wish to print a Debtors Statement
the system needs to know which address to use of the many possible addresses associated with the customer. When you
create the first address for a customer, that address gets all the system defined usages associated with it since it
is the only address available. However, when you create subsequent addresses you may choose to transfer one or more
of the usages to the new address. Only one address at a time can have a particular usage.
