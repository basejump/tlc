== Report Format Lines
=== Overview
* Define what goes 'down the page' of a Balance Sheet report
* Use line numbers to determine the sequence of printing
* Specify Chart Sections, accumulations or simple text lines
* Use a special 'divider' line to split the two 'halves' of the Balance Sheet
=== Description
Each line in your definition of what goes down the page of a Balance Sheet report
can be one of three types: Chart Section, Accumulation or Text with there being one
special 'divider' Text line allowed to split your Chart of Accounts in to the two
'sides' of the Balance Sheet.

==== Chart Section
A line that defines a Chart of Accounts section will, at that point in the report, have the contents
of that Chart Section printed. Whether this is just a summary total or a more detailed breakdown of
the section is determined by the user running the report.

[[
{{exclaim}} The system does not check that you have included in your report all Balance Sheet
Chart Sections that contain accounts. It is up to you to ensure that you include all relevant sections.
]]

==== Accumulation
A line that specifies an Accumulation can be regarded as a sub-total that you would like printing on the report
at this point. An accumulation 'formula' begins with either a plus sign (+) or a minus sign (-) to identify
whether you expect the sub-total to be a debit or a credit value, respectively. This determines whether the
resulting value is printed on the report as a positive or a negative figure. For example, if you started the
Accumulation definition with a plus sign (i.e. you expect the total to be a debit value) but it turned out
to be a credit value, then the total would be printed as a negative value since it was opposite to what you
said you expected it to be.

The remainder of the definition of an Accumulation is a comma separated list of line numbers and/or Chart
Section codes. The lines you specify by line numbers and the values of charts sections you specify by code
are summed up (allowing for debits versus credits) to give the value to be printed on the report for this
Accumulation line.
[[
{{info}} It is possible that you may be entering line numbers in other than the Hindu-Arabic numerals 0 to 9
(sometimes referred to as Western digits). If this is the case, when you specify line numbers in an Accumulation
you __must__ use numerals 0 through 9 to refer to your line number(s). An Accumulation 'formula' will __not__
recognize, for example, Thai numerals even if you that's how you enter the actual line numbers themselves.

==== Text
You may enter lines that specify neither a Chart Section nor an Accumulation. In such cases these lines will be
treated as simple text lines to be printed on the report at the appropriate point. This is even true when the
text line doesn't actually have any text! It will be treated as a blank line to be printed on the report.

==== Divider
There can be at most one divider line in your list of lines. A divider line is simply a text line where the text
is '<=>' (without the apostrophes). At this point in your report, the preceding Accumulation line will be double
underlined and then a blank line printed. This allows you to split your Balance Sheet report in to two 'sides'.

All lines in your report format must be given a line number that uniquely identifies the line and its sequence
within the report. It is recommended that you leave gaps between line numbers to allow for later alterations
(e.g. 100, 200, 300 etc rather than 1, 2, 3). You do not have to enter lines in line number order. The lines
will be redisplayed in line number order whenever you press the Update button or the Resequence button (which
also resequences your line numbers after saving the lines to the database).

[[
{{exclaim}} Because the system is backed by a database that checks that each line number within a report format
is unique, if you try, for example, to switch two line numbers around (e.g. line number 500 to 600 and line number
600 to 500) then you are likely to get an error message saying that line number 600 must be unique. This is because
the moment the database tries to update line number 500 to 600, it sees that ther is already a line number 600
without realizing that you would like, next, to change line number 600 to 500. The way around this is to change
line 500 to, say, 601 and line 600 to 501 then press the Resequence button.

[[
{{info}} Whenever you change an existing line number, whether to swap lines around as described above or simply
to change the existing line number, you must also change all references in Accumulation lines to the new line
number, where applicable, since the system will //not// do this for you automatically.
]]

At any time, you may press the More Lines button to give you some blank lines in which to add more data. You
will //not// lose any changes you have made so far when you click the More Lines button.

To delete an existing line, simply set it's line number to blank and then press the Update (or Resequence)
button.
