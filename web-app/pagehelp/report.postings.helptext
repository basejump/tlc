== Detailed Postings Report
=== Overview
* Print a list of the transactions posted within a period
* Create a single or multiple reports in one run
* Gives overall totals of balances printed for reconciliation to Trial Balance
=== Description
The purpose of the Detailed Postings report is, in essence, to give you a 'paper copy' of
your books of account on a period by period basis if this is what you require. Consequently,
the Detailed Postings report is potentially an extremely large report since it lists all the
postings made during an accounting period. For this reason you should consider running
the report during a quiet period so as not to slow down interactive users of the system.

Rather than producing one large report, you may choose to limit the scope of the report to:

* Just the Income and Expenditure section of the chart of accounts.
* Just the Balance Sheet section of the chart of accounts.
* All sections but split between the Income and Expenditure sections and Balance Sheet sections as two separate reports created from a single run.
* All sections but with each section printed as a separate report, all from a single run.
* One specific chart section.
* One specific general ledger account.

{{info}} If you choose to limit the scope of the report to a single chart section, only
the accounts within that section will be printed, //not// any sub-sections within the
chosen section.

The report prints the balances of all accounts within the scope of the report, whether they
have transactions or not, and then prints totals of all the balances it has printed at the
end of the report. In this way, not only can you test check individual account balances on
a report to the equivalent balance on the Trial Balance report, you may also reconcile the
overall totals of multiple Detailed Postings reports (such as produced by the third option
in the above list) to the overall totals of the Trial Balance report - assuming that no
postings have occurred between the two runs.

[[
{{exclaim}} The Detailed Postings report is primarily intended to be run against closed periods
to ensure that no further postings can be made to the chosen period. If you run a Detailed
Postings report against a period that is open (either fully or just for adjustments) you run
the risk of having to re-run the report all over again if postings are subsequently made to the
period. A note is made at the end of the report as to the status of the period at the point
the report was created.

An alternative to the Detailed Postings approach to creating 'paper copy' books of account is
described below...

[[
{{info}} A Posting Activity report task is available (but __not__ enabled by default) that
prints a report of all postings made (to whatever period) since the last time it was run. This
task can be scheduled to run, typically, each day so that more manageable sized reports can be
produced for those who still wish to have a 'paper copy' of their postings but do not wish to
process the larger reports created by the Detailed Postings system.
