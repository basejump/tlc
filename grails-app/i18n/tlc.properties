task.schedule.validation.error=The schedule value is not a valid schedule definition
task.nextScheduledRun.validation.error=Cannot have a scheuled run date without a schedule
task.waiting.tasks=Task {0} has entries in the queue awaiting execution. These queue entries must be deleted or executed before continuing.
task.no.combo=Invalid company and user combination
task.executable.no.instance=Unable to instantiate the executable
task.activity.no.activity=An on demand task must have an activity defined
task.user.no.user=A scheduled task must have an owing user defined
task.code.help=Task codes uniquely identify a particular task definition within the company and may be up to 10 \
  characters long. A code must start with a letter and can contain letters (A-Z and a-z), digits (0-9) and underscores.
task.name.help=Enter a descriptive name, up to 50 characters long, for this task definition.
task.executable.help=This is the name of the program to be executed. There are a fixed number of programs available. \
  If you do not know what these are, please contact the system supervisor.
task.allowOnDemand.help=Check this box if you would like end users to be able to run this task manually. Leaving this \
  box unchecked implies that this will be a scheduled run, executed automatically at intervals. A task can be both \
  scheduled and available for manual execution. If it is neither scheduled nor available on demand, then the task is \
  effectively disabled.
task.schedule.help=If this task is to be executed automatically at scheduled intervals, you need to enter the schedule \
  here. The schedule takes the form of a 'crontab' entry from the Unix 'cron' system. For example, '15 3 * * *' means \
  run at 3:15 AM every day. If you are not sure how to specify crontab entries, contact the system supervisor. NOTE \
  that the schedule is relative to the time on the server, which may be in a different time zone from you.
task.nextScheduledRun.help=For a non-scheduled run, leave this field blank. For a scheduled run, you need to specify the \
  time that the next run is to take place. This 'gets the ball rolling' after which the scheduler will take over the \
  job of scheduling following runs. The facility to edit this field also allows you to perform an intermediate run or \
  to skip a run if you wish. Enter a date and time in your local format (click on the help button near the top right hand \
  corner of the page to see your local formats) when the next run should be made. Leaving this field blank means that the \
  schedule is not to be started yet. NOTE that any date and time you enter will be relative to the server, which may be \
  in a different time zone from you.
task.activity.help=For a run that cannot be executed on demand, you may leave this field blank. For a task that can be \
  executed on demand, you need to specify the activity that a user must possess (by virtue of the roles assigned to them) \
  in order to execute this task on demand. If you are unsure of what the activities are, or which roles contain which \
  activities, contact the system supervisor.
task.user.help=For a non-scheduled run you may leave this field blank. For a scheduled run, you need to specify the user \
  in whose name the task will be executed. This is typically the company administrator (yourself!).
task.retentionDays.help=Enter the number of days that a completed task will remain in the task queue for inspection. \
  Note that some tasks may use their preceding run's results to alter the job they perform and so the retention days must \
  allow for the intervals between such runs.
task.systemOnly.help=Used only for the System company. When checked, specifies that new companies should not receive a \
  copy of this task definition.
task.propagate.help=If you click the propagate button for a task then any changes you have made to the definition will be \
  copied to all the other companies (including the System company if you are currently in some other company). Task definitions \
  flagged as being System Only or that require the sysadmin activity to run cannot be propagated. New Scheduled tasks will \
  only be propagated to companies that have a Company Administrator user defined. If you have changed the code of a task, it \
  will be seen as a NEW task.
task.propagated={0} company/companies updated

systemUser.country.help=Select the country you wish to use. The selection you make here may affect the \
  formatting of dates, numbers and text translations (if available).
systemUser.language.help=Select the language you would like to use. The language you select will affect the \
  formatting of dates, numbers and text translations (if available). Selecting any given \
  language does not imply that text translations are actually available for that language, however.

  that you are a real person and not another computer pretending to be a human.
systemUser.passwordConfirmation.help=Re-enter the password exactly as you entered it above.
systemUser.lastLogin.help=The last date and time that the user logged in. This is system maintained and you should not \
  normally need to edit it.
systemUser.disabledUntil.help=A user account can be automatically disabled on excessive failures of their login password. \
  You may also manually disable an account when a user, for example, is going on vacation or when you wish to create a user \
  account which is not for interactive use (but may be used for running reports etc).
systemUser.nextPasswordChange.help=The system obliges a user to change their password at certain intervals, or when they \
  have forgotten their password and request a new one. You may also enforce a password change manually (the next time they log in) by entering a date \
  and time here.
systemUser.oldPassword1.help=The system can enforce unique passwords by remembering old passwords they have used. The three \
  old passwords they have used are displayed in obfusticated form here. If you wish, you may clear these three entries so \
  that they can potentially re-use passwords they have used before.
systemUser.administrator.help=Checking this box gives a user total access to the system - so use with caution. There must be \
  at least one system administrator (you!)
systemUser.disableHelp.help=Check this box to disable the display of on-line help buttons against data entry fields.
systemUser.privacy=Privacy Statement: The data you enter here is used solely for the purpose of operating the system. In particular \
  your email address is used only by the system to send you reports and other information you yourself request.

  their (case sensitive) login id so that you may add them to this company.
companyUser.add.button=Add

companyUser.remove=Remove
companyUser.zero.message=This user does not belong to any other company. You may simply remove them as a member of this company, \
  leaving their login id active for future use by another company, or you may delete their login id altogether.
companyUser.one.message=This user belongs to 1 other company. You may remove them from membership of the current company but this \
  will not remove them from the other company. Only a System Administrator can delete a user from multiple companies simultaneously.

companyUser.assign.text=You are logged in to the system but are not currently assigned to a company. Contact your company administrator \
  now to be assigned to a company so that you may continue using the system. Once the company administrator confirms that you have been \
  assigned to a company, press the Continue button below. Alternatively, you may log out of the system now and await confirmation of assignment, \
  at which time you may log in again and, if the assignment has been correctly made, you will be taken to the company menu otherwise you will \
  be returned to this screen.
companyUser.assign.button=Continue
companyUser.intro.title=Introduction to the Demonstration System
companyUser.intro.text1=Welcome to our demonstration system. You have arrived at this screen for one of two reasons: Firstly, it could be \
  the first time you have registered with our system (or re-logged in to it) and have not yet created a test company for yourself. Secondly, \
  it could be that you have already created a test company for yourself and have just registered as a new user intending to use that test company. \
  Your options are described further below...
companyUser.subhead2=Creating a New Test Company
companyUser.intro.text2=If you wish to create a test company for yourself, simply fill in the details below and then press the Create button.
companyUser.subhead3=Joining an Existing Test Company
companyUser.intro.text3=If you have registered intending to be a second or subsequent user in a test company that has already been created, you now \
  need to contact the person who created the test company giving them your login id and asking them to assign you to the company. Once they have assigned \
  you to the company, simply press the continue button below. If it was you who created the test company and are creating another user for that \
  company, you can open another browser window to assign this new user to the company before pressing the Continue button on this page.
companyUser.general.helpButtons=Data entry fields have help buttons which give you information on what you are expected to enter. Use these often \
  when first getting accustomed to the system.
companyUser.general.pageHelp=On many pages, if you click the title of the page a pop up window will appear containing more generalized information than the field help buttons \
  described above. This can be useful in getting a broader overview of the area you are working in. Try it on the 'Test Company Created' heading above since this contains \
  IMPORTANT INFORMATION about your browser.
companyUser.general.localization=The system is capable of multilingual operation although all texts were originally written in English (British dialect) \
  and this remains the default language of the system. Which language you see depends upon two things: 1. the country and language selections you made in your \
  user profile (Canadian French versus French French etc) and 2. whether we have texts available within the system for your language. If you would like to help \
  to translate the system texts, please contact us from the home page of this site. Data you enter yourself is, of course, retained in your own language although \
  other users with different language settings can simply overtype your version and the system will subsequently display the preferred language version to each user.
companyUser.general.dataEntry=Dates and numbers are entered in your local format as determined by the language and country settings of your user profile. To see the \
  expected formats for entering dates and numbers, press the help button near the top right hand corner of this page, just before your name.
companyUser.general.criteria=On many pages that show lists of data, the system allows you to enter criteria to restrict what is included in the list. This can \
  be extremely helpful when trying to locate a specific item or items out of a long list. Like most systems, we use codes in the database but display a decoded \
  text version in the list. When using the criteria facility of a list page, you need to enter the code rather than what is displayed. Such fields are noted by \
  an asterisk in the criteria section. As a hint, most codes are the lower case version of the displayed English text.
companyUser.general.security=The system uses roles for enforcing system security. Menus only show you options you are allowed to use. If your menu consists of \
  nothing other than a User Administration option, then you have not been assigned any roles within the company by the company administrator. The company administrator \
  role allows a user to perform just about any function within the company. Above the company administrator and at the top of the hierarchy is the system \
  administrator. The system administrator (us for this demonstration system) is allowed to do anything at all!
companyUser.general.multicompany=This is a multi-company system and, although you may have created only a single test company, you are sharing the system with \
  other test companies created by other people. Because of this, performance will vary depending not just on the speed of the Internet, but also on \
  the load on our server at any point in time. In a live system, you would be able to create many companies all administered by a single user, if you wished. A \
  single user would also be able to use multiple companies if that was required in the live system. In this demonstration system, however, each login id is \
  associated with a single company. If you wish to have more than one company for testing purposes, please contact us (from the home page of this site) to set \
  this up for you.
companyUser.general.cleanup=Because this is a demonstration system, any user who has not logged in for 30 days will be deleted. If this means that a test company \
  no longer has any users associated with it, the company will also be deleted. This allows us to keep our system in a tidy state and helps to improve performance.
companyUser.create.title=Test Company Created
companyUser.create.text=Your company has been created and you have been assigned the role of company administrator which will allow you to perform all company \
  related activities. You will not, however, have access to system administrator facilities such as creating new companies, creating or editing roles, logging \
  user activity, tracing database activity and so forth. As a company administrator you do NOT need to be added to data access groups since you have full access \
  to all general ledger, customer and supplier accounts. The company has been given a very basic set of accounts which you are free to modify, but we suggest you \
  start by doing some basic tasks such as browsing around the menus and then printing out a chart of accounts, a trial balance and lists of suppliers and customers \
  etc. We have provided below a list of points which may be of use to you when first using the system. You may wish to print this list out for future reference. \
  Once you have read the list, click the Continue button at the bottom of the page to move to your company menu.
companyUser.attach.title=Test Company Access
companyUser.attach.text=You have been granted access to the test company. We have provided below a list of points which may be of use \
  to you when first using the system. You may wish to print this list out for future reference. Once you have read the list, click the Continue button at the \
  bottom of the page to move to your company menu.
companyUser.lastUsed.help=This date and time is set when the company user record is first created and is then automatically \
  updated each time the user connects to this company. The main purpose of this date is to allow the demo system to automatically \
  delete redundant users and so it is doubtful that you should be changing it in any way.

systemMenu.program.started=Program started successfully
systemMenu.program.failed=Program COULD NOT be started{0}
systemMenu.update.type=Cannot alter type from sub-menu when there are child records
systemMenu.delete.confirm=If this is a sub-menu, the children will be deleted also. Are you sure?
systemMenu.path.help=The data you enter here determines where in the hierarchy of menu \
  options this option will appear. If you enter a value such as 'accounts', then \
  you are specifying an option of the main menu. A path such as 'accounts.inventory' \
  specifies that the option is to be displayed in the sub-menu with the path of \
  'accounts'. The 'accounts' path record must already exist. Changing the path \
  of an existing record will reposition it (and its children if it is a sub-menu) \
  within the menu hierarchy. NOTE however, that any changes to the internationalization \
  texts of your system have to be done manually. Also note that only letters, \
  digits and the dot (.) conjunction character are allowed within a path definition. \
  A path can be up to nine levels deep and has an overall limit of 100 characters.
systemMenu.title.help=This is the text that will be displayed for the option when it is \
  shown in a menu.
systemMenu.sequencer.help=The number you enter here determines where, within the menu \
  or sub-menu to which this option belongs (per the Path definition), the option \
  will be displayed. We suggest that you leave gaps between option sequencer numbers \
  (e.g. 10, 20, 30 rather than 1, 2, 3) to accomodate later option insertions. It \
  is possible to have duplicate sequencer numbers within a particular menu path, \
  but this rather defeats the object! Sequence numbers can range from 0 to 999999.
systemMenu.type.help=Choose the type of option this record represents.
systemMenu.command.help=For a controller and action option type, enter the controller and \
  action separated by a dot, as in: inventory.list. For a sub-menu option type, \
  leave this field blank. For an external URL option type, enter the full URL that \
  you would like the option to go to (e.g. http://www.google.com). For an operating \
  system program, enter the program name and, where required, its file suffix \
  (e.g. my_program.exe). Depending upon how your operating system is set up, you \
  may need to type in the full path of the program (e.g. c:\\development\\my_program.exe). \
  You may also be able to put 'command line' parameters after the program name \
  (e.g. myprogram -nodump) etc.
systemMenu.parameters.help=For a controller and action option type, enter any parameters \
  you wish to pass. Parameters are entered as a comma separated list of pairs. For \
  example: sort:itemCode, max:50. This will pass two parameters to the target \
  controller.action, one called 'sort' with a value of 'itemCode' and the other \
  called 'max' with a value of '50'. For an external URL option type, enter any \
  parameters you would like to pass to the URL. This will be passed after the URL \
  using '?sort=itemCode&max=50' etc. For an operating system program, enter the \
  environment variables you would like to pass to the program. The program will \
  'see' the variables as sort=itemCode and max=50 etc. Note that if you include \
  a parameter with the name 'dir_' then its value will be taken to be the directory \
  that should be changed to before the program is executed. For a sub-menu option \
  type, enter text that should be displayed at the top of the page when this sub-menu \
  is displayed. If you leave this field blank, the the option's title will be \
  used as the menu title.
systemMenu.activity.help=Select the activity that this menu option is a part of for \
  security checking purposes.

  measure/scale combination and another measure/scale combination. For example, creating a conversion between inches and centimeters \
  may become slightly inaccurate when miles are converted to kilometers. Although the inaccuracy is usually insignificant, you could \
  if you wish create a specific miles to kilometers conversion to avoid even this slight inaccuracy. The system will always attempt to \
  pick the most accurate conversion available depending upon the units involved.

  For example, converting from Farenheit to Centigrade would require a pre-addition of -32.
systemConversion.multiplier.help=Enter the number of target units per source unit. For example if the source unit is inches and the target \
  unit is centimeters then enter 2.54 since one inch is equivalent to 2.54 centimeters. Up to 10 digits are allowed after the decimal separator \

  which means that if the customer/supplier has a tax code from this authority then the document lines may or \
  may not have tax codes from this authority (but not from other authorities) and 3) Ad-Hoc is similar to the \
  Optional setting with the addition that if the customer/supplier has NO tax code then the document lines may \
  or may not use tax codes from this authority.

documentType.name.help=Enter a descriptive name for this document type. It is possible that the code may appear on \
  documents sent to third parties. Names can be up to 30 characters long.
documentType.nextSequenceNumber.help=Enter the next sequence number to use when creating documents of this type. \
  WARNING: If you already have documents of this type in the system, reducing this number may cause duplication \
  errors.
documentType.type.help=The 'type' is an internal code used by the programs to identify what sort of document type this is. \
  For example, you may define two types of sales invoice, one with a code of, say, SI (for Sales Invoice) and another with a \
  code of, say, ESI (for Export Sales Invoice). They should both be defined as being of type 'Sales Invoice', however, so \
  that the programs know how to process them. Once you have created a new document type, you can NOT change its type, although \
  you may be able to delete it and re-create it with a different type, if you wish.
documentType.autoGenerate.help=Check this box if you would like the system to automatically generate document 'numbers' for \
  you. Clear the box if you wish to allow users to manually enter the document 'number'. Note that document 'numbers' are \
  actually held as strings and can therefore contain any characters rather than just digits.
documentType.allowEdit.help=Set this flag if the user is intended to enter the document 'number' rather than having the \
  system automatically generate it for them. Note that it is possible to have both the Auto Generate and Allow Edit flags \

documentType.autoForeignCurrency.help=For automatic payment of suppliers, if this box is checked then suppliers can be paid in their \
  account currency even when this is different from the bank account currency. If the box is unchecked then only suppliers whose \
  account is in the same currency as the bank account can be paid via this document type. In the case of payments in 'foreign' currencies \
  (i.e. different from the bank account currency) a separate document is created for each currency involved.
documentType.autoMaxPayees.help=For automatic supplier payments, specify the maximum number of payees that can be included in one document. \
  A value of 1 means that each payment uses its own document. A value of 100 would mean that up to 100 payees can be included in a single \
  document thus, effectively, making the document a 'payment list' such as used in automated bank transfers. Do not make this number too \
  large or the document will become unwieldy and will take a long time to post. If this is not to be an automatic payment document type, \
  leave this field blank.
documentType.autoBankAccount.not.payment=Auto payment details can only be specified for a Bank Payment document type
documentType.autoBankAccount.not.bank=The selected account is not a bank account

documentType.autoPayments=Auto Payments
documentType.autoBankDetails.help=If this document type is to be used for making automatic payments to suppliers and this document type requires \
  that the supplier's bank details be completed, check this box. Otherwise, leave this box unchecked.

codeElement.elementNumber.help=The element number must range from 1 through 8 and there must always be an element 1. \
  Element 1 is special in that it must represent the 'account number' element where 'account number' is used to identify \
  which section of the Chart of Accounts the account belongs (Revenue, Fixed Assets etc). The 'account number' element \
  is typically numeric and is often around six digits long. Other element numbers need not be consecutive and can represent \
  any additional breakdowns of the 'account number' in to sub-accounts. Typical uses of these additional elements are to \
  break an account down by Cost Centre, Project and so forth.
codeElement.name.help=Enter a descriptive name for this code element of up to 30 characters.
codeElement.dataType.help=Select the data type for this code element. Numeric codes must use the digits 0 through 9. \
  Alphabetic codes by default use letters A through Z, but your system may have been configured to use lower case \
  a through z.
codeElement.dataLength.help=Select the length of the data for this code element, from 1 to 10. Code values for this \
  element must be exactly this length. For example, if you specify the data type as being numeric and the length as 3, \
  then valid code values will be such as 000, 010, 100, 999 and so forth. Note the leading zeros on the first two examples.

chartSection.default7.default.val=The default for segment {3} does not exist as a code element value
chartSection.default8.default.val=The default for segment {3} does not exist as a code element value
chartSection.pattern.no.number=One of the code segments must contain the account number element
chartSection.pattern.ambiguous=The segments contain two adjacent optional elements of the same length and data type. \
  The code structure is therefore ambiguous since, if only one segment was entered, the system would be unable to determine which \
  segment was being defaulted.
chartSection.path.bad=Invalid path
chartSection.path.levels=A path can only have nine levels
chartSection.path.help=The path is a dot delimited definition of where this chart section exists within the hierarchy of the \
  Chart of Accounts. A path such as 'revenue' is a top level section since it has no dot in it. A path such as revenue.sales \
  is a second level section where the code of the section is sales and it belongs to a parent with a code of revenue. Similarly, \
  a path such as revenue.sales.software is a third level section with a code of software and which belongs to the sales second \
  level section. Each section's code (i.e. that last - or only - portion of its path) must be unique within the company. Codes \
  may be up to 10 characters long, must begin with a letter which can then be followed by letters or digits, and can be nested \
  up to nine levels deep in the path. Changing the parent of a section by altering its path will also move all its children.
chartSection.code.help=The code of a chart section uniquely identifies that section within the overall Chart of Accounts.
chartSection.code.letter=The chart section's code must begin with a letter
chartSection.name.help=Enter a descriptive name for this chart section of up to 50 characters.
chartSection.sequencer.help=Within a parent section, child sections are ordered by a sequencer value which must be unique within that parent. \
  This is simply an integer (0..999999) that orders the children within their parent section. Similarly, for top level sections, the sequencer \
  value orders the top level sections within the chart as a whole. Within a section, accounts are listed in ascending order of their account codes.
chartSection.segments.help=There can be up to eight code segments within an overall account code. If you do not intend to create accounts \
  in this section, leave the segments blank. For sections intended to contain accounts (as opposed to just sub-sections), each segment used must be \
  one of the code elements you have defined, but you need not use all code elements and the segments need not be in the same \
  order as the code element numbers. You MUST include the 'account number' code element (element number 1) in one of your segments \
  since, using the ranges associated with a chart section, the 'account number' element identifies which chart section any particular account \
  belongs to.
chartSection.defaults.help=You can specify a default for a code segment which, from the end user's point of view when entering full \
  account codes, makes the segment optional. If they miss the segment out, the default value will be used. For example, if the last \
  segment of a full account code was a 'Cost Centre' segment defined as being three digits long, and you had defined a default on this \
  segment of 000 (meaning, say, Head Office), then if the end user did not enter the 'Cost Centre' segment, a value of 000 would be \
  used. You can not put a default on the segment that uses the 'account number' element.
chartSection.type.help=All Chart of Account sections must be marked as being either of Income and Expenditure (also know as \
  Profit and Loss) type or of Balance Sheet type. For all top level sections (i.e. ones with no parent section other than \
  the Chart of Accounts itself) you must select which type of section this is. For all child sections, since a child section \
  must be of the same type as its parent, you may as well leave this set to 'none' since no matter what you enter for a child section \
  it will always be set to the same type as its parent. Note that a chart section type affects what accounts may be placed within the \
  section. For example, you can't place a bank account in an Income and Expenditure section.
chartSection.autoCreate.help=For a section that can contain accounts (as opposed to just sub-sections), check this box to allow the system \
  to automatically create accounts within the section. If the box is un-checked, you will have to manually create all valid combinations of \
  account codes (account number, department code, project code etc) permitted in this section.
chartSection.status.help=Select whether accounts created in this section are expected to normally have debit or credit balances. \
  If this section is not intended to contain accounts, enter the expected state of the total of accounts within its sub-sections. \
  This setting may be used by reports to control what is displayed as a 'negative' value (i.e. opposite to what is specified here). \
  NOTE that changing the status of a chart section does not propagate down to its accounts or sub-sections. You must change these manually \
  if this is your intention.
chartSection.accounts.bad=The change of type would leave accounts in section {0} invalid
chartSection.child.bad=Unable to save child section {0}
chartSection.ranges.bad=The change of segments would leave the ranges for section {0} invalid
chartSection.default.bad=The default for segment {0} is not within the ranges for this section
chartSection.autoCreate.bad=The auto create flag cannot be set for a section that cannot contain accounts (i.e. segment 1 is blank)
chartSection.no.default=You cannot add a new code segment to an active section without supplying a default value to update its accounts with
chartSection.no.value={0} is not a valid default value
chartSection.range.save=Error saving the modified range records
chartSection.account.save=Error saving the modified account records
chartSection.print=Print Chart Of Accounts

  should be the full account code to be created. The system will use the ranges of your chart sections to determine which \
  section the account should be placed in. Consequently, you might wish to use the Test Account Auto-Creation menu option to check that \
  your section ranges are set up correctly. You may optionally include a second field in the lines to be imported, in which \
  case that field should contain the account name. If you do not include this second field, the system will create an account \
  name for you from the code element values. If there are more than two fields on a line, the additional fields will be \

  Also, when auto creating element values, the name of the value will simply be set to the new code you entered for \
  that element.
account.status.help=Select whether this account is expected to normally be a debit or credit balance. This setting may \
  be used by reports to control what is displayed as a 'negative' value (i.e. opposite to what is specified here). It \
  is also used when importing budget figures in to the system where a positive budget figure is assumed to be of the \
  'sign' specified here. NOTE, however, that changing the status of an account will NOT change existing loaded budget \
  values. You must change them manually if this is your intention.
account.recurring=You cannot change the type from being a bank account when it has recurring transactions defined
account.auto.payment=You cannot change the type from being a bank account when it has Auto-Payment Document Types using it
account.auto.active=You cannot disable a bank account that has Auto-Payment Document Types using it

  For example, March 2010 might be given a code such as '2010-03'. Alternatively, you may choose to number periods within the \
  accounting year to which they belong so, for example, an accounting year ending at the end of June 2010 might use a code \

  you entered IS the last day of a month, you should check this box if all recurring payments are also to be on the last day of the month. For example, if you \
  entered a Recurs From date of the 30th April and checked this box, the payments/receipts would be made on the last day of each appropriate month. If you had \
  NOT checked this box, however, the payments/receipts would be made on the 30th of each relevant month (or 28th/29th of February if applicable).
recurring.recurringValue.help=Enter the amount of an individual recurring payment/receipt.

systemAddressFormat.mandatory=Mandatory
systemAddressFormat.pattern=Pattern
systemAddressFormat.code.help=Enter a unique code between 1 and 10 characters long. The code must begin with a letter A to Z or a to z and \
  may then contain letters, digits 0 to 9 and underscores (_).
systemAddressFormat.name.help=Enter a name of up to 30 characters that describes the purpose of this address format.
systemAddressFormat.field.help=Select the field to be entered by/displayed to the user. Do not leave blank lines between field definitions. \
  You must include all of the Company, Contact, Identifier and Country placeholder fields that MAY be included when an address is displayed, \
  but which are NOT entered by the user as part of the address. The user will see/enter address fields in the order you specify them here, but \
  are stored in the database (excluding the placeholder fields) by the field you select. For placeholder fields, any other data you specify for \
  the line will be ignored.
systemAddressFormat.prompt.help=You may select up to three prompts per field. The prompts are placed at the side of the data entry area when the \
  user is entering an address. Multiple prompts will be separated by slash marks (/) as in State/Province/Region etc.
systemAddressFormat.width.help=Enter the width of the data entry area for when the user is entering an address. Display widths can be from 1 to 50. \
  Display widths DO NOT limit the amount of data the user can enter (see the Pattern help for that), but merely alter the width of the area they can \
  enter data in to. The display width of a field can be a useful hint to a user as to what sort of data is expected. For example, setting a State data \
  entry area to be two characters wide gives a user a good hint that the State code (e.g. CA) is expected rather than the full name of the State (e.g. \
  California).
systemAddressFormat.joinBy.help=When an address is formatted for display, you may wish for some of the fields to appear together on a single line \
  rather than on separate lines as they were entered by the user. To place the current field on the same line as the preceding field when the address \
  is displayed, enter a value in the current line's Join By field. Do not use spaces in the Join By field, but rather underscores (_) which will be \
  translated to spaces when the address is displayed. To join a field to the previous field without ANY intervening characters, set the Join By field \
  to a single vertical bar character (|). The single vertical bar will be omitted when the fields are concatenated. Any other characters in the Join By \
  field will be taken literally. When the address is constructed for display, if the preceding line is blank the Join by Characters will be omitted. The \
  Join By information you enter, if any, can be up to 20 characters long.
systemAddressFormat.mandatory.help=Check this box if the user must enter a value for this field.
systemAddressFormat.pattern.help=The system uses regular expressions (also called regex) to validate the data the user enters. If you wish to validate \
  the data the user enters in this way, enter a regular exression of up to 100 characters as the pattern. For example, entering a pattern of [A-Z][A-Z] \
  will require the user to enter two (and only two) upper case Latin letters, as often used for State abbreviations. To find out more about regular \
  expressions, search the Internet for regex.

  are selecting which report format to run. The name can be up to thirty characters long and must be unique within your company.
profitReportFormat.title.help=Enter the title that should appear on the report. This may be up to thirty characters long and can \
  contain special 'place holders' as follows: {sPd} will be replaced by the code of the period the user selects to run the report for; \
  {sYr} will be replaced by the code of the year to which the selected period belongs; {cPd} will be replaced by the code of the comparative \
  period (i.e. the same period as the selected period, but in the preceding year) and {cYr} will be replaced by the code of the comparative \
  year (i.e. the year containing the comparative period). Include the curly braces and remember that the place holders are case sensitive.
profitReportFormat.subTitle.help=You may optionally enter a Sub-Title for the report of up to thirty characters in length. Any Sub-Title \
  you enter will be printed under the report Title. You may use the same 'place-holders' as for the Title.
profitReportFormat.column1Heading.help=Enter the heading that is to appear over this column of the report. This may be up to ten characters long \

  year (i.e. the year containing the comparative period). Include the curly braces and remember that the place holders are case sensitive.
profitReportFormat.column1SubHeading.help=You may optionally supply a Sub-Heading of up to ten characters for a column. Any Sub-Heading you \
  enter will be printed below the relevant Heading. You may use the same 'place-holders' in the Sub-Heading as for the Heading.
profitReportFormat.column1PrimaryData.help=Select the data that you wish to display in this column of the report, or wish to include in a calculation \
  to determine the values to be displayed. If you do not wish to display any data in this column, choose 'none'. The selections available consist of the \
  combination of three component parts: Selected or Comparative; Period or Year-To-Date and Actuals (with or without adjustments) or Budgets. \
  The 'Selected' options refer to the year and period that the user chooses to run the report for whereas the 'Comparative' options refer to the \
  year prior to the selected year plus the equivalent period within that year. 'Period' options refer to values for the specific period whereas \
  'Year-To-Date' options refer to the cumulative values up to and including the specific period. The 'Actuals' options refer to the actual posted \
  values (either including or excluding transactions that were flagged as being adjustments when they were posted) whereas the 'Budgets' options \
  refer to the budget values that you have entered in to the system.
profitReportFormat.column1Calculation.help=If you select 'none' then the data displayed in this column of the report will simply be that selected \
  as the Primary Data for this column. If you select Difference as the calculation for this column then the Secondary Data value will be subtracted \
  from the Primary Data value and the resulting monetary amount will be the value displayed in this column (typically used for displaying the monetary \
  difference between actuals and budgets). Selecting Variance as the calculation will subtract the Secondary Data value from the Primary Data Value \
  and then express the result as a percentage of the Secondary Data value (typically used for displaying the variance percentage between actuals and \
  budgets). Selecting Total Percentage as the calculation will lead to the Primary Data value being expressed as a percentage of the Chart Section(s) \
  identified as forming the Total involved. Typically, the Chart Section(s) representing Sales would be selected as the Total to use so that setting \
  this column's Calculation to Total Percentage would lead to the percentage of Sales (including gross profit percentage) being displayed here. By \
  convention, such percentages are always shown in absolute form (i.e. always as positives), unlike variances.
profitReportFormat.column1SecondaryData.help=If you chose 'none' or Total Percentage as the Calculation type, then leave this field set to 'none'. \
  If you chose Difference or Variance as the Calculation type, specify the secondary data that is to be subtracted from the Primary Data.
