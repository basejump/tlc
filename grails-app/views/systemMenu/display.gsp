    The following tag (also used in the <title> region above) is specific
    to the menu page and determines what title to display. The default is
    only used for the main menu, all sub-menus have their title in their
    domain record.
    --%>
    <h1><g:menuTitle default="Main Menu"/></h1>

        The following tag is specific to the menu page and is used to display
        a breadcrumb trail so that the user may move backwords through the
        menu hierarchy. The default is used only for the main menu since all
        sub-menus use the last node in their path as their own crumb. By
        default, when the main menu is displayed, no breadcrumb trail is displayed
        since there is nowhere to go back to. However, you can force a breadcrumb
        trail to be displayed even for the main menu by including an attribute of
        single="true" in the following tag.
        --%>
        <g:menuCrumbs default="Main"/>
